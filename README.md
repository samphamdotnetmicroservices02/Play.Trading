## Build the Docker image
```powershell
$version="1.0.2"
$env:GH_OWNER="samphamdotnetmicroservices02"
$env:GH_PAT="[PAT HERE]"
$acrName="samphamplayeconomyacr"

docker build --secret id=GH_OWNER --secret id=GH_PAT -t play.trading:$version .

or

docker build --secret id=GH_OWNER --secret id=GH_PAT -t "$acrName.azurecr.io/play.trading:$version" .

-t is tag, tag is really a human friendly way to identify your Docker image, in this case, in your 
box. And it is composed of two parts. The first part is going to be kind of the name of image, and
the second part is the version that you want to assign to it.
the "." next to $version is the cecil file , the context for this docker build command, which in this case
is just going to be ".", this "." represents the current directory
```

```mac
version="1.0.2"
export GH_OWNER="samphamdotnetmicroservices02"
export GH_PAT="[PAT HERE]"
docker build --secret id=GH_OWNER --secret id=GH_PAT -t play.trading:$version .

```
verify your image

```

## Run the docker image
```powershell
$cosmosDbConnString="[CONN STRING HERE]"
$serviceBusConnString="[CONN STRING HERE]"

docker run -it --rm -p 5006:5006 --name trading -e MongoDbSettings__Host=mongo -e RabbitMqSettings__Host=rabbitmq --network playinfra_default play.trading:$version

if you do not use MongoDb and RabbitMQ from Play.Infra, you can remove --network playinfra_default

docker run -it --rm -p 5006:5006 --name trading -e MongoDbSettings__ConnectionString=$cosmosDbConnString -e ServiceBusSetting__ConnectionString=$serviceBusConnString -e ServiceSettings__MessageBroker="SERVICEBUS" play.trading:$version

-it: what it does is it creates and kind of an interactive shell, so that you will not able to go back to your
command line until you cancel the execution of these docker run command.

--rm: means that the docker container that is going to be created has to be destroyed as soon as you exit
the execution of these docker run command. That is just to keep things clean in your box.

-p: -p 5006:5006 it means 5006 on the right side is the port of docker container, the left side is port of your
local machine

--name: this is optional

-e: this is environment variable. MongoDbSettings__: MongoDbSettings comes from appsettings.json, the double underscore "__" allows you to specify envinroment variables that will end up in configuration with the same shape that we have, this is the file in the appsettings.json. "MongoDbSettings__Host" Host represents the property in MongoDbSettings in appsettings.json, this will override whatever configuration you specified in appsettings.json
"MongoDbSettings__Host=mongo" mongo is the container_name that we name it in Play.Infra

--network playinfra_default: run "docker network ls" to check your playinfra network. "playinfra_default" comes from
this network. This is a network that has been created by docker compose for everything that we declared in this
docker compose file. So all the containers running in or declared in docker compose (Play.Infra) are running 
within a single network, docker network. And that is how they can reach out to each other easily. However our
microservice is going to be running externally to this. They are not going to be running within these docker
compose file.
So how can they reach out to containers are running in a different network? So we have to find a network for
the docker run command. So we have to add parameter that specifies that we want to connect to the same network
where all the other containers are running "playinfra_default (RabbitMq and Mongo)"

And lastly we have to specify the docker image that we want to run (play.trading:$version)
```

```mac
cosmosDbConnString="[CONN STRING HERE]"
serviceBusConnString="[CONN STRING HERE]"

docker run -it --rm -p 5006:5006 --name trading -e MongoDbSettings__Host=mongo -e RabbitMqSettings__Host=rabbitmq --network playinfra_default play.trading:$version

if you do not use MongoDb and RabbitMQ from Play.Infra, you can remove --network playinfra_default

docker run -it --rm -p 5006:5006 --name trading -e MongoDbSettings__ConnectionString=$cosmosDbConnString -e ServiceBusSetting__ConnectionString=$serviceBusConnString -e ServiceSettings__MessageBroker="SERVICEBUS" play.trading:$version

```

## Publish the image
```powershell
$acrName="samphamplayeconomyacr"

az acr login --name $acrName

docker tag play.trading:$version "$acrName.azurecr.io/play.trading:$version"

docker images (check your images for ACR)

docker push "$acrName.azurecr.io/play.trading:$version" (go to your ACR -> Repositories to check your images)


az acr login: in order to be able to publish anything into ACR, you will have to first log in into it. Because remember that an ACR is a private repository.
So people cannot just connect to it from anywhere without providing credentials. It is not a repository like it will be the case in Docker Hub.
This is private, so you need credentials to be able to access it. So to do that, what you can do is use the AZ ACR login command from Azure CLI

docker tag play.trading:$version: The next thing we want to do is a retagging of your image, so that it is ready to be published to ACR. In order to be
able to publish these to ACR, you have to have the name of the repository of your image, has to match a combination of the login server of your ACR
and the accurate repository name (samphamplayeconomyacr.azurecr.io/play.trading:$version, samphamplayeconomyacr.azurecr.io comes from your login server of ACR)

docker push: publishing image
```

```mac
acrName="samphamplayeconomyacr"

az acr login --name $acrName

docker tag play.trading:$version "$acrName.azurecr.io/play.trading:$version"

docker images (check your images for ACR)

docker push "$acrName.azurecr.io/play.trading:$version" (go to your ACR -> Repositories to check your images)

```
