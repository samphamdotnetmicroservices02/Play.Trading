So what we're going to do is to start splitting these yaml files (identity.yaml, signing-cer.yaml) into new files that are going to
start following the structure that is required for the Helm chart.
So the first thing we're going to do is to create at the root of our repository, we're going to call "helm" (folder), and inside this
directory we're going to create anothe directory that we're going to call templates.
All Helm charts are based on templates where you can define the structure of your Kubernetes application, and in there you can leave 
place holders to replace values at the time where you are going to install this application in Kubernetes

After copy all files in to kubernetes directory to helm/templates directory
Now the idea of these templates is, like I said we're going to leave placeholders in these files so that they become templates
as opposed to concrete a specifications of various specific resources. However, if these are going to be templates there has to be 
some place where we can define a specific values that we're going to inject into a template. So that place is what we call the values files,
and that's a file we have to create in the root helm directory
